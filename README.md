# Snake-Game

This project was asked of me in my first semester at university
in c++ language, the project is the retro nokia snake
game, the project included a main menu, an ability to change
the snake color and shows the player's score and is best
score.

Snake game is a sub-genre of action video game where
the player maneuvers the end of a growing line,
often themed as a snake. from colliding with both
other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the
snake lengthens.
